	<h2>1. Air Pick</h2>
	<p>Air picks are designed not cause any damage to buried cables, utility lines, and roots. It provides a safe method of working around pipes and cables by blowing high pressure air through a nozzle into the ground to loosen material. <img src="images/Air Pick G-15.jpg" alt="Air Pick">A special nozzle has been used to increase the velocity of the air flowing through the outlet at the tip. This sharp air pick allows to loosen certain points of the ground.

	<h2>2. Air Pick Machine</h2>
	<p>Surface-mount technology (SMT) component placement systems, commonly called pick-and-place machines or P&Ps, are robotic machines which are used to place surface-mount devices (SMDs) onto a printed circuit board (PCB) <img src="images/Air Pick machine.jpg" alt="Air Pick Machine">They are used for high speed, high precision placing of a broad range of electronic components, for example capacitors, resistors, integrated circuits onto the PCBs which are in turn used in computers, consumer electronics as well as industrial, medical, automotive, military and telecommunications equipment. Similar equipment exists for through-hole components.[1][2] This type of equipment is sometimes used to package microchips using the flip chip method.

	<h2>3. Brazing rod</h2>
	<p>Brazing rods are used in welding. Brazing rods are used in brazing, a type of welding that uses acetylene to join metal pieces together. Brazing is typically used when joining pieces of the same metal type, such as steel to steel or copper to copper. <img src="images/brazing rod.jpg" alt="Brazing rod">Brass brazing rods are composed mainly of copper and zinc, with traces of tin, lead, and other metals in varying proportions depending on the type. The copper provides strength to the joint while the zinc gives it ductility or flexibility. Tin improves corrosion resistance, while lead enhances its melting point.

	<h2>4. Ladel opening picture</h2>
	<p>It is basically an arcing process, arcing between molten metal and the graphite electrodes. After tapping the molten steel from Electric Melting Furnaces or BOF the molten steel is further refined in LRF with tight control of ladle metallurgy for producing high grades steels with controlled chemistry. <img src="images/Ladel opening picture.jpg" alt="Ladel opening picture">Treatment ladle: a ladle used for a process to take place within the ladle to change some aspect of the molten metal. A typical example being to convert cast iron to ductile iron by the addition of various elements into the ladle.

	<h2>6. Pneumatic hammer</h2>
	<p>A device in which a chisel, rivet set, or other tool is driven percussively by compressed air. called also pneumatic hammer. <img src="images/Pneumatic hammer.jpg" alt="Pneumatic hammer">The pneumatic hammer, also called air hammer, power hammer, or air chisel, is a power tool that uses compressed air exclusively. The tool is used to carve, drill, or chip away at stone, metal, and other hard materials. Air hammers are used to cut through a surface, dig a hole, smoothen a surface, or shape one.

	<h2>7. Receptacle & tips</h2>
	<p>Compressed air is pumped into the cylinder to make the piston move up and down to imitate the up and down of a hammer. While going up and down, the piston opens the air rams or valves that allow the compressed air to enter the cylinder to keep the piston moving. <img src="images/Receptacle & tips.jpg" alt="Receptacle & tips">All Trow & Holden Pneumatic Hammers require an in-line air pressure of 90â€“110 psi. This is a fairly standard level of pressure for most compressors, at which there will be a corresponding CFM rating (rate of air flow in cubic feet per minute).
